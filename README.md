# Repository of the codefair material for the BOSC 2024 conference (July 14-18 2024)

## About

This repository contains the material and information associated with our poster presentation and talk at the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) 2024. We are presenting Codefair, an open source and free GitHub app for making biomedical research software FAIR.

Making research software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR), i.e. optimally reusable by humans and machines, is crucial to ensure the reproducibility of research outcomes, prevent duplicate effort, and utimately increase the pace of discoveries and innovations. The [FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines](https://fair-biors.org/) provide step-by-step actionable guidelines for making software FAIR. Yet, these guidelines can be time consuming and difficult to implement. To address that, we are developing codefair, a GitHub app that allows you to make biomedical research software FAIR without breaking a sweat! You can find out more about codefair at [codefair.io](https://codefair.io/).
